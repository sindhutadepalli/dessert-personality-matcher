# dessert-personality-matcher
Ever wondered what dessert mirrors your soul? This quirky yet insightful web app blends playfulness with personality theory to match you with an iconic sweet treat — from the calm depth of Kulfi to the spontaneous chaos of Falooda.

How it works:
Users rate themselves on five personality traits — Introversion, Energy, Spontaneity, Sweetness, and Weirdness — and the fuzzy logic-inspired algorithm maps them to a dessert with a relatable description. Think of it as a lighthearted mirror to your moods, quirks, and charm — served with sugar on top.
